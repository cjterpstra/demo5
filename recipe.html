    <h1><b>Haluski Recipe</b></h1>
    <h2><i>HISTORY</i></h2>
    <p>My grandmother always cooks me Haluski when I come over. This recipe has been passed down for generations and is my favorite Hungarian dish. My aunt and my grandparents are Hungarian and love to share the cultured food with me. The background of Haluski can be debatable, but can be claimed in some form or another by the Polish, Slovaks, Ukrainians, and Hungarians. Haluski is served during the winter months along with soups and stews. Haluski is a simple dish that contains <b><i>cabbage and onions fried in butter, then tossed with egg noodles, salt, and pepper.</i></b> This dish is one that I look forward to, and you should too.</p>
    <h2><i>DESCRIPTION</i></h2>
    <p>Haluski is a Hungarian dish that is beloved by many Hungarians. It can vary many different ingredients to your liking.</p>
